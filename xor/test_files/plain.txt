in the early hours of sunday november daylight saving time comes
 to an end in most of the country people are supposed to turn th
eir clocks back an hour so they will have one more hour to rest 
but there are exceptions the time change is not observed in the 
states of arizona or hawaii or united states territories such as
 puerto rico and the virgin islands daylight saving time is the 
tradition of moving the clocks forward one hour in march and tur
ning them back again in november americans use the expression sp
ring forward fall back to remember which way to set their clocks
 american benjamin franklin first proposed the time change in he
 liked the idea of moving clocks forward to take advantage of mo
re sunlight during the summer months franklin wrote every mornin
g as soon as the sun rises let all the bells in every church be 
set ringing and if that is not sufficient let cannon be fired in
 every street to wake the sluggards this led some people to beli
eve that the proposal to move the time forward was just an attem
pt to make late sleepers get up early in germany and britain agr
eed to the time change during world war i to save energy when th
e united states entered the war congress passed a law in to adop
t daylight saving time the practice ended in because american fa
rmers objected but returned in after the us entered world war ii
 after the fighting stopped american states and towns were given
 a choice whether to keep daylight saving time for a time this l
ed to a freeforall system with people never really sure about th
e timing of bus and train service congress passed a law to keep 
the time uniform across the country however several states inclu
ding hawaii and arizona kept control of the local time
